Case study about the healthcare system in the United States of America.

**Objectives of the Healthcare System Case Study**

1. Identify Factors Influencing Processing Time and Cost Determine which factors (e.g., claim amount, provider, diagnosis code, procedure code) are most strongly associated with longer processing times and higher costs.
2. Detect Patterns and Anomalies Identify patterns that could indicate systematic issues, such as certain providers consistently submitting incorrect claims or specific diagnosis codes that are associated with higher denial rates.
3. Predict Processing Time and Cost using ML Based on your data analysis and EDA, create a predictive model (use any algorithm of your choice) to predict processing time and processing cost. Also, show the driving factors for your predictions
4. Provide Actionable Recommendations Based on your analysis, propose specific actions to streamline the claims processing workflow, reduce costs, and improve accuracy.
